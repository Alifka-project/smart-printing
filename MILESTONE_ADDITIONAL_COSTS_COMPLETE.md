**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Scope:** Step 4 Operational → Step 5 Quotation Integration

## 🚀 **Achievement Summary**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Data Structure Updates**
- ✅ Added `additionalCosts` field to `QuoteFormData` interface
- ✅ Updated `CreateQuoteModal` initialization to include `additionalCosts: []`

### **2. Step 4 Integration**
- ✅ Additional costs stored in `formData.additionalCosts` array
- ✅ Each cost includes: `{ id, description, cost, comment }`
- ✅ Real-time calculation integration in `calculateTotalCost()`
- ✅ Display in "Other Costs" section with individual breakdown

### **3. Database Persistence**
- ✅ Added `additionalCosts: { create: ... }` to `completeQuoteData` in `handleSaveQuote`
- ✅ Additional costs saved to database with quote creation
- ✅ Database schema updated with `AdditionalCost` model

### **4. Step 5 Integration**
- ✅ Updated `calculateSummaryTotals()` to include additional costs
- ✅ Added `totalAdditionalCost` calculation
- ✅ Additional costs added to `grandTotal` and `totalSubtotal`
- ✅ Real-time updates with `formData.additionalCosts` dependency

### **5. User Interface**
- ✅ "Additional Costs" line in Step 5 pricing summary
- ✅ Conditional display (only shows when costs exist)
- ✅ Blue color coding for additional costs
- ✅ Proper currency formatting

## 📊 **Complete Flow**

1. **Step 4**: User adds description, cost, comment → `formData.additionalCosts`
2. **Step 4**: Additional costs appear in "Other Costs" section
3. **Step 4**: Additional costs included in total calculation
4. **Step 4 → Step 5**: Data flows through `formData`
5. **Step 5**: Additional costs calculated and displayed in pricing summary
6. **Step 5**: Additional costs included in final total calculation
7. **Save**: Additional costs persisted to database with quote

## 🎯 **Key Features**

- **✅ Real-time Calculation**: Additional costs update totals immediately
- **✅ Data Persistence**: Additional costs saved with quotes
- **✅ User-Friendly**: Clear display in both Step 4 and Step 5
- **✅ Validation**: Comment field mandatory for additional costs
- **✅ Integration**: Seamless flow between steps

## 📁 **Files Modified**

1. `types/index.d.ts` - Added `additionalCosts` to `QuoteFormData`
2. `components/create-quote/CreateQuoteModal.tsx` - Initialization
3. `components/create-quote/steps/Step4Operational.tsx` - Integration
4. `app/(root)/create-quote/page.tsx` - Database persistence
5. `components/create-quote/steps/Step5Quotation.tsx` - Display & calculation
6. `lib/database.ts` - Database service updates
7. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema

## 🧪 **Testing Status**

- ✅ **Step 4 Input**: Additional costs can be added, edited, deleted
- ✅ **Step 4 Calculation**: Additional costs included in total
- ✅ **Step 4 Display**: Shows in "Other Costs" section
- ✅ **Step 4 → Step 5**: Data flows correctly
- ✅ **Step 5 Calculation**: Additional costs included in summary totals
