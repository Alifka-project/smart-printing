**Date:** September 16, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Backup:** `data/backup-20250916-141907-pdf-download-buttons-fixed`

## 📋 Summary

Fixed the PDF download buttons in the dashboard and quote management system that were broken due to incorrect function imports. The issue was resolved by restoring the original `quote-pdf.ts` file and correcting the import statements.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### **Problem:**
- PDF download buttons in quote management page were not working
- Import statement was referencing `generateOperationalPDF` instead of `downloadOpsPdf`
- Complex byte handling was causing download failures

### **Root Cause:**
- Previous changes accidentally deleted the original `quote-pdf.ts` file
- Quote management page was importing the wrong function name
- Mismatch between function signatures and usage

## 🛠️ Technical Changes Made

### **Files Modified:**

#### 1. **`app/(root)/quote-management/page.tsx`**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
import { downloadCustomerPdf, generateOperationalPDF } from "@/lib/quote-pdf";

// AFTER (FIXED):
import { downloadCustomerPdf, downloadOpsPdf } from "@/lib/quote-pdf";
```

#### 2. **Download Logic Simplified:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (COMPLEX):
const pdfBytes = await generateOperationalPDF(quote.id, mockFormData);
const blob = new Blob([pdfBytes], { type: 'application/pdf' });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const link = document.createElement('a');
link.href = url;
link.download = `operational-job-order-${quote.id}.pdf`;
link.click();
URL.revokeObjectURL(url);

// AFTER (SIMPLE):
await downloadOpsPdf(mockFormData, []);
```

#### 3. **`lib/quote-pdf.ts`**
- ✅ Restored original file from git history
- ✅ All PDF generation functions intact
- ✅ Professional layouts maintained
- ✅ All previous enhancements preserved
