## Summary

## Completed Revisions

### 1. Output Item Size Fields Made Read-Only ✅
- **Issue:** User reported Output Item Size fields appeared editable and could cause confusion
- **Solution:** 
  - Added `readOnly` and `disabled` attributes to both width and height input fields
  - Updated styling with `bg-slate-100 text-slate-500 cursor-not-allowed` for clear visual indication
  - Changed icon from `Edit3` to `Info` to reflect read-only nature
  - Updated section title to include "(From Step 3 - Read Only)" for clarity
  - Removed `onChange` handlers since fields are now read-only

### 2. Sheet Management Validation Updated ✅
- **Issue:** User wanted ability to enter sheets less than recommended with justification option
- **Solution:**
  - Removed restriction that prevented entering values below recommended sheets
  - Changed `min` attribute from `recommendedSheets` to `0` to allow any value
  - Updated validation message from "Cannot be less than recommended sheets" to "⚠ Less than recommended" with amber warning
  - Added "Add justification" button that prompts users to provide reason (like "No TRN", "Special arrangement", etc.)

### 3. Paper Specifications Title Updated ✅
- **Issue:** User requested changing "Paper Specifications" to "Paper Details"
- **Solution:**
  - Updated card title from "Paper Specifications" to "Paper Details"
  - Updated corresponding title in modal dialog for consistency

### 4. Pricing Section Title Updated ✅
- **Issue:** User requested changing "Pricing" to "Paper Pricing"
- **Solution:**

  - Updated comment from "CARD 2: Pricing" to "CARD 2: Paper Pricing"

### 5. Cost Per Item Removed from Pricing Summary ✅
- **Issue:** User requested removing "Cost per item" line from pricing summary
- **Solution:**
  - Removed the "Cost per item" calculation line
  - Removed explanatory note about cost per item including all project costs
  - Kept "Cost per sheet" calculation which is still relevant for paper pricing

### 6. View Pricing Logic Modal Updated ✅
- **Issue:** User provided image showing specific requirements for pricing methods modal
- **Solution:**
  - Updated formula in first rule to use `[(Sheets needed ÷ Sheets per packet)]` instead of ceiling notation

  - Removed "(Recommended)" from "Hybrid Pricing" text
  - Maintained original title "Pricing Logic & Calculation Methods" and subtitle

   />
   ```

3. **Justification System:**
   ```tsx
   {opPaper?.enteredSheets && opPaper.enteredSheets < recommendedSheets && (
     <div className="text-amber-600 text-xs mt-1 flex items-center gap-2">
       <span>⚠ Less than recommended ({recommendedSheets})</span>
       <button onClick={() => { /* justification prompt */ }}>
         Add justification
       </button>
