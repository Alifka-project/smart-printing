# MILESTONE: Visualization Sections Hidden for Client Clarification

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Type:** Temporary Feature Hiding  

## Overview
This milestone marks the temporary hiding of two visualization sections in Step 4 Operational page while preserving all code for future restoration after client clarification.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hidden Sections
- **Cutting Layout Visualization** (lines 5090-5195)
  - Shows how input sheet is cut for machine compatibility
  - Includes cutting strategy and results information cards
  - Canvas visualization of cutting operations

- **Final Printing Layout Visualization** (lines 5197-5243)
  - Shows final printing layout on cut pieces
  - Business card arrangement visualization
  - Total output items calculation

### 2. Implementation Method
- Used conditional rendering with `{false && (...)}` instead of commenting out
- This approach completely hides sections from UI while keeping all code intact
- No linting errors introduced
- Code remains fully functional and can be easily restored

### 3. What Remains Active
- **Single Sheet Layout Visualization** - Main visualization section showing:
  - Print Layout view
  - Cutting Operations view
  - Gripper Handling view
  - Professional visualization with different product types

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `components/create-quote/steps/Step4Operational.tsx`
  - Lines 5090-5195: Cutting Layout Visualization hidden
  - Lines 5197-5243: Final Printing Layout Visualization hidden

### Code Structure
```jsx
{/* Section Name - TEMPORARILY HIDDEN FOR CLIENT CLARIFICATION */}
{false && (
  // All original code preserved here
)}
```

## Restoration Instructions

When ready to restore after client clarification:

1. **For Cutting Layout Visualization:**
   ```jsx
   // Change line 5091 from:
   {false && (
   // To:
   {true && (
   ```

2. **For Final Printing Layout Visualization:**
   ```jsx
   // Change line 5198 from:
   {false && (
   // To:
   {true && (
   ```

## Backup Information
- **Backup Location:** `../Smart-printing-update-backup-visualization-hidden-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
- **Backup Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M:%S)
- **Backup Reason:** Temporary hiding of visualization sections for client clarification

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Wait for client clarification on visualization requirements
2. ⏳ Restore sections once requirements are clarified
3. ⏳ Implement any necessary changes based on client feedback

## Related Issues
- Client needs clarification on Final Printing Layout visualization
- Expected 20×14 grid vs current 14×9 grid discrepancy
- Business card dimensions and layout calculations need verification

## Notes
- All visualization functions remain intact (`drawCuttingLayout`, `drawFinalPrintingLayout`)
- All calculation logic preserved (`calculateCutPieces`, `calculateCutStrategy`)
- No impact on other parts of the application
- Development server runs without errors
- No linting issues introduced
