// BACKUP: Step3ProductSpec.tsx - Size Autofill Fix
// Date: 2024-12-19 14:30:00
// Description: Fixed size autofill issue that was incorrectly resetting all products to 9x5.5
// Key fixes:
// 1. Fixed safety check to use product-specific defaults instead of hardcoded 9x5.5
// 2. Improved initialization logic to only reset truly empty sizes
// 3. Enhanced product name change logic to preserve existing valid sizes
// 4. Fixed special product handling for cups and shopping bags

// This is a backup marker file. The actual backup was created by copying the working Step3ProductSpec.tsx file.
// The file contains the complete fix for the size autofill issue.
