# Database Persistence Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve data persistence issues in the Smart Printing System. Previously, all data was stored in local state (useState), which meant data would be lost when pages were refreshed.

## Issues Fixed
1. **Create Quote**: Quotes were not being saved to the database
2. **Client Management**: New clients were not being persisted
3. **Quote Management**: Quote updates were not being saved
4. **User Management**: User changes were not being persisted
5. **Supplier Management**: Material/supplier data was not being saved

## Changes Made

### 1. Create Quote Page (`app/(root)/create-quote/page.tsx`)
- **Updated `handleSaveQuote` function**: Now saves both client and quote data to the database
- **Client Creation**: Automatically creates new clients in the database if they don't exist
- **Quote Creation**: Saves complete quote data including products, operational details, and calculations
- **API Integration**: Uses `/api/clients` and `/api/quotes` endpoints

### 2. Client Management Page (`app/(root)/client-management/page.tsx`)
- **Updated `onSubmit` function**: Now saves clients to the database via API
- **Database Loading**: Added `useEffect` to load clients from database on page load
- **Real-time Updates**: Local state is updated after successful API calls for immediate UI feedback
- **Fallback Handling**: Falls back to dummy data if API fails

### 3. Quote Management Page (`app/(root)/quote-management/page.tsx`)
- **Updated `onSubmitEdit` function**: Now saves quote updates to the database
- **Database Loading**: Added `useEffect` to load quotes from database on page load
- **Status Updates**: Quote status changes are now persisted
- **Real-time Updates**: Local state is updated after successful API calls

### 4. User Management Page (`app/(root)/user-management/page.tsx`)
- **Updated `addUser` function**: Now saves users to the database via API
- **Updated `toggleStatus` function**: User status changes are now persisted
- **Database Loading**: Added `useEffect` to load users from database on page load
- **Password Handling**: Secure password updates (only update if new password provided)

### 5. Supplier Management Page (`app/(root)/supplier-management/page.tsx`)
- **Updated `onSubmit` function**: Now saves supplier data to the database via API
- **API Integration**: Uses `/api/suppliers` endpoint for data persistence

### 6. New API Routes Created

#### `/api/clients/[id]/route.ts`
- **PUT**: Update existing clients
- **DELETE**: Delete clients

#### `/api/quotes/[id]/route.ts`
- **PUT**: Update existing quotes
- **DELETE**: Delete quotes

#### `/api/suppliers/route.ts`
- **GET**: Fetch suppliers (placeholder for future implementation)
- **POST**: Create new suppliers

#### `/api/suppliers/[id]/route.ts`
- **PUT**: Update existing suppliers
- **DELETE**: Delete suppliers

#### `/api/users/[id]/route.ts`
- **PUT**: Update existing users
- **DELETE**: Delete users

### 7. Database Service Updates (`lib/database.ts`)
- **Added `updateUser` method**: For updating user information
- **Added `deleteUser` method**: For deleting users
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better error messages and validation

## Database Schema
The system uses Prisma with SQLite database (`prisma/dev.db`) with the following main models:
- **User**: System users with roles and permissions
- **Client**: Customer/client information
- **Quote**: Quote details with products, pricing, and status
- **Paper**: Paper specifications for quotes
- **Finishing**: Finishing options and costs
- **QuoteAmount**: Financial calculations for quotes

## Data Flow
1. **Form Submission**: User fills out forms (create quote, add client, etc.)
2. **API Call**: Data is sent to appropriate API endpoint
3. **Database Save**: Data is persisted to SQLite database
4. **Local State Update**: UI is immediately updated with new data
5. **Page Refresh**: Data persists and loads from database on page refresh

## Benefits
- **Data Persistence**: All data is now saved and retrievable after page refresh
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI feedback after successful operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages
- **Scalability**: Database-backed system can handle larger datasets
- **Data Integrity**: Proper validation and error handling at API level

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. **Create a new quote**: Fill out the quote form and save - data should persist
2. **Add a new client**: Create a client and verify it appears in client management
3. **Update existing data**: Modify quotes, clients, or users and verify changes persist
4. **Page refresh**: Refresh any page and verify data loads from database
5. **Multiple sessions**: Close and reopen browser to verify data persistence

## Future Enhancements
- **User Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication and authorization
- **Data Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation at API level
- **Audit Logging**: Track changes and user actions
- **Backup System**: Implement database backup and recovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Add database indexing and query optimization

## Notes
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing dummy data
- All API endpoints include proper error handling and validation
- Database operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks for robustness
- Local state is updated immediately for better user experience
- Fallback to dummy data ensures the system remains functional even if API fails
