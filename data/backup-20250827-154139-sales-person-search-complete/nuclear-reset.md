# üö® NUCLEAR OPTION: Complete Prisma Reset

If the current deployment still shows SQLite, here's the nuclear option:

## Option 1: Remove Prisma Client Completely
```bash
# Remove Prisma client from package.json
npm uninstall @prisma/client

# Remove Prisma from package.json  
npm uninstall prisma

# Clear all cache
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.prisma

# Reinstall everything
npm install

# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

## Option 2: Force Fresh Vercel Deployment
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí General
4. Scroll down to "Build & Development Settings"
5. Click "Clear Build Cache"
6. Redeploy

## Option 3: Delete and Recreate Project
1. Delete the project from Vercel
2. Reconnect your GitHub repo
3. This forces a completely fresh deployment

## Why This Happens
- Vercel caches the old Prisma client
- Even schema changes don't force client regeneration
- Build cache prevents fresh Prisma generation

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Database URL is correct
- ‚úÖ Data is migrated and accessible  
- ‚ùå Prisma client is still old SQLite version
- üîÑ Need to force complete regeneration
