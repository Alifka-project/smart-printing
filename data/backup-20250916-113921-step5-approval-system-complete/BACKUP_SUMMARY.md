## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management:
```typescript
// New approval status state in create-quote page
const [requiresApproval, setRequiresApproval] = useState(false);
const [approvalReason, setApprovalReason] = useState<string | undefined>();

// Approval status callback handler
const handleApprovalStatusChange = (needsApproval: boolean, reason?: string) => {
  setRequiresApproval(needsApproval);
  setApprovalReason(reason);
};
```

### Conditional Modal Logic:
```typescript
// Smart button display based on approval status
{!requiresApproval && (
  <>
    <Button>Send to Customer</Button>
    <Button>Download for Customer</Button>
  </>
)}
```

### Approval Detection:
```typescript
// Real-time approval calculation
const needsApproval = requiresApproval(
  currentDiscountPercentage,
  currentMarginPercentage,
  currentTotalAmount
);
```

## Business Rules Implemented

### Approval Triggers:
- Quote value ≥ AED 5,000
- Discount percentage ≥ 20%
- Margin percentage < 10%

### Button Behavior:
- **No Approval:** All buttons available
- **Approval Required:** Only internal operations available

### User Workflow:
1. Create quote → System detects approval needs
2. If approval required → Only "Send for Approval" available
3. If no approval → All options including "Send to Customer"
4. Success modal shows appropriate actions
